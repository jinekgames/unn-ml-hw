U must have `pyhton` (3 ver. (3.12.0 was used)) being installed and available from `PATH`

before running notebook, init running `./init.bat`

Some settings could be changed from `./config.py`. By default dataset is downloaded from `DATASET_URL`. If `PRELOADED_DATASET_PATH` is set, it will override the download.
